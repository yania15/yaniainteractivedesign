<h1> Unexpected Connections </h1>

<h2> Tina Bell</h2>

<div img id="fencebckgrnd" src="brokenfence1.png">

<h3> Tina Bell was an American singer and songwriter, front woman of the Seattle-based rock band called Bam Bam. </h3>

<h3> Bam-Bam was highly overlooked and was one of the first bands to cultivate the grunge-rock sound that we all know from popular bands such as Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Sound Garden, and Mudhoney. </h3>

<h3> Bam-Bam was formed in 1983 by producer and guitarist Tommy Martin and included Matt Cameron, Scotty Buttocks, Nick Rhinehart, Mike Peterson, Tom Hendrickson, Paul Hinklen, and Tina Bell. 
</h3>

<h2> Bam-Bam's Story</h2>

<h3>What set Bam Bam apart from the vast majority of rock bands in the Seattle scene was that Tina Bell was one of the first African-American women to become a front-woman for a grunge band in the U.S. 
  Most African-American women in the rock-music scene were pushed under the radar due to racism and misogyny. </h3>

<h3> Tina Bell faced many obstacles such as racists throwing objects and spewing racial slurs while performing on stage. 
  Often unfairly compared with other rising African-American women of the 1980s such as Tina Turner, 
  Tina Bell was discriminated against and audiences were not yet ready for a black woman to reach high levels of fame for the rock genre which was already dominated by white men.
  </h3>
 <h3> Bam Bam never received the recognition they should have received until well after Tina Bell's death in 2012.
  Even though she was met with multiple setbacks, she never stopped carrying Bam Bam with her fiery and restless soulful energy.

<div id="albumexplanation"> These two albums included sans-serif typography with minimalistic elements reminiscent of Constructivism with bold red shapes and dynamic geometric lines.
Lots of grunge albums incorporated a unique type of font instead of using fonts that were considered generic. </div>

<h3> "To the credit of this younger generation, theres a desire to see people of colour in non-stereotypical spaces," said Tina Bell and Tommy Martin's son, TJ Martin. </h3>
